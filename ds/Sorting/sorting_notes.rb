# The "best" sorting algorithm depends on various factors, including the size and nature of the data, 
# as well as the requirements of the application (e.g., time complexity, space complexity, stability, etc.). 
# Here are some commonly used sorting algorithms and their characteristics:

# 1. Quick Sort
# Average Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
# Worst Case Time Complexity: 
# 𝑂(𝑛2)(can be improved with random pivoting)
# Space Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# log
# ⁡
# 𝑛
# )
# O(logn)
# Stability: Not stable
# Usage: Preferred for large datasets; widely used in practice due to its average-case efficiency.
# 2. Merge Sort
# Time Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# log
# ⁡
# 𝑛
# )
# O(nlogn) for all cases
# Space Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# )
# O(n)
# Stability: Stable
# Usage: Suitable for large datasets and linked lists; ensures consistent performance.
# 3. Heap Sort
# Time Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# log
# ⁡
# 𝑛
# )
# O(nlogn) for all cases
# Space Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 1
# )
# O(1)
# Stability: Not stable
# Usage: Useful for large datasets where memory usage is a concern.
# 4. Insertion Sort
# Average Time Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# 2
# )
# O(n 
# 2
#  )
# Best Case Time Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# )
# O(n)
# Space Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 1
# )
# O(1)
# Stability: Stable
# Usage: Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted data.
# 5. Bubble Sort
# Time Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# 2
# )
# O(n 
# 2
#  )
# Space Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 1
# )
# O(1)
# Stability: Stable
# Usage: Simple but inefficient for large datasets; educational purposes.
# 6. Selection Sort
# Time Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# 2
# )
# O(n 
# 2
#  )
# Space Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 1
# )
# O(1)
# Stability: Not stable
# Usage: Simple but inefficient for large datasets; educational purposes.
# 7. Radix Sort
# Time Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑑
# ⋅
# (
# 𝑛
# +
# 𝑘
# )
# )
# O(d⋅(n+k)) where 
# 𝑑
# d is the number of digits and 
# 𝑘
# k is the range of the digits
# Space Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# +
# 𝑘
# )
# O(n+k)
# Stability: Stable
# Usage: Efficient for sorting numbers, particularly when the range of the digits is not significantly larger than the number of items.
# 8. Tim Sort
# Time Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# log
# ⁡
# 𝑛
# )
# O(nlogn) for all cases
# Space Complexity: 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# )
# O(n)
# Stability: Stable
# Usage: Hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort; used in Python’s built-in sort (sorted() function) and Java’s Arrays.sort().
# Conclusion:
# For large, unsorted datasets: Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
# For nearly sorted or small datasets: Insertion Sort.
# When stability is required: Merge Sort or Tim Sort.
# When memory usage is a concern: Heap Sort.
# Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the application.
