In Ruby, lambda is a type of anonymous function that can be created using the lambda keyword or the shorthand ->. A lambda is a way to define a block of code that can be passed around as an object, similar to a Proc.

Here's an example of creating a lambda in Ruby:

python
Copy code
my_lambda = lambda { |x| x * 2 }
This creates a lambda that takes one argument and doubles it. The lambda can then be called using the call method or the shorthand [] syntax:

python
Copy code
my_lambda.call(3)   # returns 6
my_lambda[4]        # returns 8
One important difference between lambdas and Procs in Ruby is that lambdas enforce arity, which means they will raise an error if the wrong number of arguments is passed to them. Procs, on the other hand, will silently ignore extra arguments or fill in missing ones with nil.

cpp
Copy code
my_proc = Proc.new { |x| x * 2 }

my_proc.call(3, 4, 5)   # returns 6, ignoring extra arguments

my_lambda.call(3, 4, 5) # raises ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 3, expected 1)
Overall, lambdas are a useful tool for creating self-contained blocks of code that can be passed around as objects and called at a later time.

In Ruby, a proc is an object that represents a block of code that can be saved and executed later. It's similar to a lambda, which is another way of defining a block of code in Ruby.

A proc can be created using the Proc.new method or by using the proc method. Here's an example:

go
Copy code
my_proc = Proc.new { puts "Hello, world!" }
This creates a new proc object that contains the block of code that simply outputs "Hello, world!" to the console.

Once a proc is created, it can be called using the call method, like this:

c
Copy code
my_proc.call  # outputs "Hello, world!"
Procs can also take arguments, like this:

c
Copy code
my_proc = Proc.new { |name| puts "Hello, #{name}!" }
my_proc.call("John")  # outputs "Hello, John!"
In this example, the proc takes one argument, name, and outputs a personalized greeting using that argument.

Procs are often used in Ruby as a way of passing a block of code as an argument to a method, or as a way of defining a piece of code that can be run later on.
