# Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.
# Example 1:
# Input: ["23:59","00:00"]
# Output: 1
# Note:
# The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
# The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.
