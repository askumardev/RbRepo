# Given a string s, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

# Return the power of the string.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leetcode"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "triplepillooooow"
# Output: 5
# Example 4:

# Input: s = "hooraaaaaaaaaaay"
# Output: 11
# Example 5:

# Input: s = "tourist"
# Output: 1
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 500
# s contains only lowercase English letters.
