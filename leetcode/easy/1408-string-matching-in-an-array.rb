# Given an array of string words. Return all strings in words which is substring of another word in any order. 

# String words[i] is substring of words[j], if can be obtained removing some characters to left and/or right side of words[j].

# Example 1:

# Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
# Output: ["as","hero"]
# Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
# ["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
# Example 2:

# Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
# Output: ["et","code"]
# Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
# Example 3:

# Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
# Output: []
 
# Constraints:

# 1 <= words.length <= 100
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
# words[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
# It's guaranteed that words[i] will be unique.
