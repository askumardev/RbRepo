# Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

# You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

# Example 1:

# Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
# Output: true
# Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
# Example 2:

# Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
# Output: false
# Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
# Example 3:

# Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
# Output: true
# Example 4:

# Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
# Output: true
# Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.
 
# Constraints:

# 1 <= name.length <= 1000
# 1 <= typed.length <= 1000
# The characters of name and typed are lowercase letters.
