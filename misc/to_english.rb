# Method name: to_roman
# Inputs:      A number
# Returns:     A String representing the number in English
# Prints:      Nothing

# Write a method that takes a positive integer as input and returns the input
# in "plain English."  For example,
#
#   to_english(1)     == "one"
#   to_english(12)    == "twelve"
#   to_english(123)   == "one hundred twenty three"
#   to_english(1234)  == "one thousand two hundred thirty four"
#   to_english(12345) == "twelve thousand three hundred forty five"
#
# You can decide the largest power of 10 you wish to support, but you should
# support at least up to the billions.

# Hint #1
# Write down a bunch of examples and look for patterns.
# What words make up "special cases?" There are likely fewer than you think
# if you can find ways to combine simpler patterns into larger ones.
