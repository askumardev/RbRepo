# Method name: time_format
# Inputs:      A number, representing seconds
# Returns:     A string, describing the number of weeks, days, minutes, seconds
# Prints:      Nothing

# Remember when we wrote the countdown clock to count down from 5 minutes?
# Let's write a method that takes in an integer, representing a number of
# seconds, and returns a string describing larger chunks of time.  For example,
#
#   time_format(1234)  == "20m 34s"
#   time_format(12345) == "3h 25m 45s"
#
# This should support weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

  # Write your own test cases!  These four won't suffice.
  # Notice that we're looking at "edge" cases. We likely want to test
  # the boundaries where the parts "flip over", and also one output on
  # each side of that boundary, i.e., exactly 1 hour, 1 hour plus 1 second,
  # and 1 hour minute 1 second.
  #
  # Why? This is where our code is most likely to "go wrong."
