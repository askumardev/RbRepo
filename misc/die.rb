# Classes: Die

# Your job is to implement the Die#roll instance method.  We've hard-coded
# the number of sides and assigned it to the @sides instance variable --
# don't change that!

# Die#roll should return a random number between 1 and the value of
# the @sides instance variable.

class Die
  def initialize
    @sides = 6
  end

  # This method should return a random number between 1 and the
  # value of the @sides instance variable (6, in this case).
  def roll
    # This is your job. :)
  end
end

# Don't change any of this code.  It's here to tell you when your method isn't
# working.  Since we're dealing with random behavior, there's a (small) chance
# that this code will run even if your Die#roll method isn't working.
