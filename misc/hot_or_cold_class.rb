# Classes: HotOrCold

# We're going to object-orient-ify the hot_or_cold kata.
# The class only handles the guessing aspect.  If we think of our code
# as a model of some real-world situation, the class would represent
# a single person who has picked a number in their head.  Anyone can
# guess as to the number and the person will say "too hot", "spot on", or
# "too cold", but they will never change the number in their head.

class HotOrCold
  def initialize(number_to_guess)
    @number_to_guess = number_to_guess
  end

  # Returns the String "hot" if number given is too large, the String "cold" if
  # number given is too small, and the String "correct" if number given is
  # correct.
  def hot_or_cold(number)
    # Hint: we'll ened to be comparing number to @number_to_guess
  end
end

# A helper method to prompt the user for input and return whatever they type

# Don't change this code!  If your HotOrCold#hot_or_cold method is working
# correctly, the code below will work without changing.
