# This is how we require the print-triangle.rb file in the current folder.
# We can now use the "print_triangle" and "print_line" methods we defined
# there -- as if we defined them here!

def print_pyramid(height)
  # This is your job. :)
  # Suggestion: you can call print_triangle to print out the first, "upward"
  # half of the pyramid. You'll have to write code to print out the second,
  # "downward" half of the pyramid.
