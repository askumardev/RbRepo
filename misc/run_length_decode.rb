# Method name: run_length_encode
# Inputs:      A String that has been "run-length encoded"
# Returns:     The original string
# Prints:      Nothing

# This takes a run-length encoded string and "reconstructs" the original string.

  # If both methods are implemented correctly, this should always be true:

  #   run_length_decode(run_length_encode(string)) == string
